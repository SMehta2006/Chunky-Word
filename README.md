# Chunky Word App

Chunky Word is an interactive tool designed to assist language learners with phonetic breakdown and pronunciation. Inspired by hands-on teaching experience with students and adults, this project emphasizes accessible language learning through engaging, user-friendly design. By entering a word, users receive phonetic components, which are then played back for auditory reinforcement. This tool is ideal for users looking to strengthen their foundational language skills through practical phonetic analysis and interactive learning. Built using JavaScript and React, Chunky Word leverages responsive UI design and audio APIs to create an enjoyable, educational experience.
